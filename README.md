We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love DevOps. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller connected yet manageable pieces within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of Terraform open source and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have fifty plus terraform modules. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.

Prerequisites
This module has a few dependencies:

Terraform 1.x.x
Go
github.com/stretchr/testify/assert
github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
Examples
IMPORTANT: Since the master branch used in source varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions here.

Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:

Private Subnet
 module "subnets" {
  source      = "./../"
  name        = "subnet"
  environment = var.environment
  label_order = var.label_order

  availability_zones = ["ap-south-1a", "ap-south-1b"]
  vpc_id             = module.vpc.vpc_id
  type               = "private"
  igw_id             = module.vpc.igw_id
  cidr_block         = module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block
  ipv6_cidr_block    = module.vpc.ipv6_cidr_block
}

Public Subnet
 module "subnets" {
  source      = "./../"
  name        = "subnet"
  environment = var.environment
  label_order = var.label_order

  availability_zones = ["ap-south-1a", "ap-south-1b"]
  vpc_id             = module.vpc.vpc_id
  type               = "public"
  igw_id             = module.vpc.igw_id
  cidr_block         = module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block
  ipv6_cidr_block    = module.vpc.ipv6_cidr_block
}

Testing
In this module testing is performed with terratest and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a GO environment in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:

  go test -run Test
